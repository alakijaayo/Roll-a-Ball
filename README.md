# Roll-a-Ball

Using the tutorial provided by [Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial) on their website, the aim of this project is to build an easy game called Roll-a-Ball where the person has to collect certain objects to win the game.
This projects will be done using C# and Unity, the engine used to build the game. I am using it to gain a bit of insight into how games are made using this language and further develop myself. There will be no testing, unfortunately I have no idea how to test in this language. After going to Global Game Jam and seeing what can be done, it mixes my love of games with my love of coding so trying to see what I can do.
